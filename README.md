# HFA (Hybrid Face Assembly)
公式仕様 v0.1

HFA defines kaomoji and symbols as first-class instructions
in a state-driven, semantics-oriented language design.

## Key Design Points
- Kaomoji are treated as opcodes, not comments or aliases
- Explicit ZERO state (capability exists but is not exercised)
- Instruction validity depends on runtime state
